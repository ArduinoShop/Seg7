MAX7219 Seven Segment LED Tube Library for Arduino  AVR/ESP32/ESP8266

I wanted to use an 8 digit 7-segment LED Tube on my ESP32 project but could not find one I liked.  They all seemend to be only for AVR, using delay() which can mess up WiFi..

Soooo...  I wrote my own - maybe it will help, or at least, make life easier others...

The ".h" file is the best reference on using it.  It should pick up the board type automatically from the IDE.
